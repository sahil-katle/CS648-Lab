# Lab 1 – JavaScript Conditionals and Loops

This lab contains **eight JavaScript exercises** that focus on practicing **conditional statements and loops**.  
Each exercise is written in its own JavaScript file inside the `js/` folder.

## How to Run

- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- Inside `index.html`, **uncomment only one `<script>` tag at a time**.
- Comment out the remaining script tags so multiple files do not run together.
- Refresh the page to see the output of the selected exercise.

## Output

- Some exercises use `prompt()` and `alert()` for user input and interaction.
- Exercises that use loops print their results to the browser console using `console.log()`.
